/// \section communication_protocol Communication protocol
///
/// When the onboard service is \ref drone::start "started", it listens for the
/// commands from a user. The figure below shows how the I-Seed Drone Control
/// Android application communicates with the I-Seed onboard service. The
/// Android application runs on an Android phone connected to the droneâ€™s
/// remote control via a USB cable. The commands are noted in uppercase. If
/// extra parameters for a command are needed, they are sent/received as the
/// follow-up message with data.
///
/// \image html protocol.jpg
///
/// When a connection is established between the application and the drone, the
/// application will send the \b PING command and will wait for a reply with the
/// \b PING command back. This one needed to verify that communication is
/// actually working because the API peculiarity is that all the
/// interconnections return successful codes, but the real packets will start
/// receiving later.
///
/// There is a service running in a background thread on the drone that
/// periodically sends the current mission states and its geographical
/// coordinates. The drone service sends a \b DRONE_COORDINATES command to
/// inform the Android app that a coordinate data and mission state message will
/// follow.
///
/// When the drone operator is ready, a mission can be started via the Android
/// application interface. This action sends a \b MISSION_START command to the
/// drone service. Following the \b MISSION_START command, the drone service
/// expects the coordinates of the waypoint the drone will have to navigate.
/// The waypoint is sent via a \c pin_coordinates message. Pin coordinates will
/// be taken from the Google Map widget of the Android app.
///
/// During a mission, a drone operator can pause, resume, or abort its
/// execution. This is achieved by sending \b MISSION_PAUSE,
/// \b MISSION_CONTINUE, and \b MISSION_ABORT commands, respectively,
/// to the drone service.
///
/// The full mission consists of a forward mission (when we take photos and run
/// inference in the background) and a backward mission (when we revisit
/// waypoints where objects were detected and run laser measurements for each
/// object). In both cases, when
/// \ref mission::waypoint_reached "a waypoint is reached", the mission is
/// paused, and custom code is run in the \c action_job thread. If a forward
/// mission is finished, the mission type is
/// \ref mission::set_backward "changed to backward",
/// and a similar cycle continues until ready.
///
/// If an I-Seed is detected in a waypoint during a forward mission, the range
/// between the camera and the I-Seed needs to be known. For this, the DJI
/// Zenmuse H20/T laser rangefinder is used in a waypoint during a backward
/// mission. However, there is no API call for the \c %laser_range data
/// available from the Payload SDKs, one needs to use a hack to retrieve this
/// information from the Mobile SDK. The onboard service emits a \b LASER_RANGE
/// command to the Mobile SDK that runs with the Android app to achieve this.
/// After that, the Mobile SDK sends the \c %laser_range message back to the
/// onboard service that uses this information to compute the geolocalisation
/// of the I-Seed.
///
/// It's not possible to know beforehand the actual height of the
/// drone above the ground. We only know the actual height after laser
/// measurement of the place received. The \b LASER_RANGE command will be used
/// in this case too. If the actual height is too low or
/// too high, the mission waypoint's height has to be corrected.
///
/// \section control_app I-Seed drone control
///
/// There are a UI system thread that receives UI events and three custom
/// threads: reading/writing from pipe (interconnection) and a polling job that
/// checks the state. The \c executeCommands is a buffer with commands.
///
/// UI thread will process the events from the drone operator.
/// E.g., if a user wants to abort the mission, command \c MISSION_ABORT put
/// into a queue. When \c writePipelineJob takes control of the queue, it reads
/// \c MISSION_ABORT and is responsible for sending it to a drone.
///
/// Read-from-pipe thread with the \c readPipelineJob method will process the
/// commands received from the drone. When the \b PING command is received, it
/// means communication with a drone is established, and a drone is ready to
/// accept other commands. \b DRONE_COORDINATES command informs that
/// coordinates with the mission state data are prepared. Drone coordinates are
/// used for drawing drone icons in the Google Map widget. Mission state will
/// be used to draw the controlling UI buttons. E.g., if a mission is stopped,
/// UI is switched to the state when an operator can start a new mission.
/// When \c readPipelineJob receives a \c LASER_RANGE request from the drone,
/// it is put into a queue. When \c writePipelineJob takes control of the queue,
/// it reads \c LASER_RANGE and sends it to the drone, but this time command is
/// sent with the data - the value of laser range measurement.
///
/// The \c pollJob method is the main point of calling Mobile SDK API. It is
/// responsible for initialization. It periodically checks the state of a
/// connected smart controller, updates UI widgets, checks the pipeline,
/// checks the GPS signal, enables laser, etc.

///
/// After the drone is started, there are five threads:
/// - Payload SDK callback thread, that's where asynchronous callbacks from
///   Payload SDK live. E.g., we can receive an event that the mission is
///   finished or the waypoint reached (see \ref mission and
///   \ref mission_state). Note that there should be no time-consuming calls
///   or blocks here. The callback should be finished as soon as possible
/// - \c inference_job checks for
///   \ref camera_psdk::check_sdcard "new files on SDCard", and if a new JPG
///   file is found, it
///   \ref inference::run "launches the inference"
///   and \ref mission::save_detection "saves the result back"
///   to the \ref waypoint::save_detection "waypoint data"
/// - \c receive_data_job is reading pipe. That's where commands and data (like
///   \ref laser_range::value_received) from the Android app come from
/// - \c send_data_job is writing commands to pipe, commands are read from
///   \c execute_commands_ queue, if needed extra data send as a follow-up
/// - \c action_job is executed when we reach a waypoint. Most of the mission
///   it's in the waiting state. That's where we can
///   \ref camera_psdk::shoot_photo "start shooting a photo",
///   \ref laser_range::latest "request for laser range", and calculate the
///   \ref converter "ECEF coordinates" of
///   \ref detection_result "detected objects"
